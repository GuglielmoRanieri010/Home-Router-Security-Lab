# 🔍 What I Did - Step by Step

## Setup
- Installed Kali Linux on VirtualBox
- Created isolated lab network
- Got my home router ready for testing

## Steps I Followed
1. **Scanned the network** - Found all connected devices
2. **Checked router security** - Looked for open ports and weak settings  
3. **Tested vulnerabilities** - Safe testing in my lab environment
4. **Documented everything** - Wrote down what I found and how to fix it

## What I Learned
- How routers can be vulnerable
- Importance of security settings
- How to protect home networks

*All testing was done safely in my own lab - no real networks were harmed!*
